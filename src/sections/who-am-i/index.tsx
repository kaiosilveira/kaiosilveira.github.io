    <JustifiedParagraph>
      I'm a person who occasionally started writing code around seven years ago and since then
      became obsessed with it. I like playing games with my son (who aims to be a gamer when he
      grows up) and walking around the city to think about life and all the things. Professionally,
      I've worked for many different companies in many different domains and acquired a lot of
      technical knowledge out of that, specially in web development. I care a lot about software
      architecture and code quality, that's why I'm always trying to improve my own assumptions and
      to solidify more and more my knowledge base by reading tech books and staying tuned with
      newly-released, up and coming technologies.
